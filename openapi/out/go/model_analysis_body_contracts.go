 * Mythril API
 *
 * The Mythril service is currently in closed alpha. API keys are made available to selected community members (join the Mythril Discord to request one).  **Note that the interface will still undergo significant changes.**  Mythril is a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses concolic analysis, taint analysis, and control flow checking to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities.  Mythril API exposes this functionality over the network.  In the future this API will integrate a number of other security analyzer tools seemlessly.

// Currently we only accept `bytecode` for the type value.  An array of contract strings must be given.  A contract string is EVM bytecode in hex. It can optionally have `0x` prepended at the front.  Examples:   ```json   {   \"type\": \"bytecode\",   \"contracts\":     - \"6004f3\"     - \"0x6003f3\"   }   ``` 
type AnalysisBodyContracts struct {
	Type string `json:"type"`
	Contracts []string `json:"contracts,omitempty"`
}
