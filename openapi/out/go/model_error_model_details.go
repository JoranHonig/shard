 * Mythril API
 *
 * The Mythril service is currently in closed alpha. API keys are made available to selected community members (join the Mythril Discord to request one).  **Note that the interface will still undergo significant changes.**  Mythril is a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It uses concolic analysis, taint analysis, and control flow checking to detect a variety of security vulnerabilities.  Mythril API exposes this functionality over the network.  In the future this API will integrate a number of other security analyzer tools seemlessly.
